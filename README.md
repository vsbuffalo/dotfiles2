## Dotfiles2

Removing the cruft from my first dotfiles. Out with the old, in with the new!

⚠️**Warning**: If you use my `dotfiles2`, you *must* modify this to your own
purposes! For example, `.gitconfig` contains my Git configurations, including
my email, etc. Simply cloning this repository and running the setup will result
in your Git commits being made under *my* name and email, and neither of us
want that.

## Installation

This will bootstrap things:

    bash setup.sh

## Configurations

 - `.zsh`: antidote for plugins.

## Caveats

So far only tested on OS X.
